# Net-Promoter-Score
NPS stands for Net Promoter Score. It's a customer satisfaction benchmark that measures how likely your customers are to recommend your business to a friend. 
It is a typical benchmark companies measure to evaluate and improve customer loyalty. 
The survey asks its customers, "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend us to someone". 
Scores 0-6 are Detractors, scores 7-8 are Passives, and scores 9-10 are Promoters.
Disregarding the Passives, subtract the percentage of Detractor responses from the percentage of Promoter responses to determine your Net Promoter Score. This score can range from -100 to 100.

Here, we have used LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) and GRU(Gated Recurrent Units).
